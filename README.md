# Predicting High-Risk and Low-Risk Online Purchase Orders

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the risk of default payment for online purchase orders. 
Using a dataset with 30,000 records, each order is classified as either high-risk or low-risk based on 44 attributes.

## Files Included
- **Midterm_final.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full code, explanations, and outputs.
- **Midterm_final.py**: Python script version of the code, suitable for command-line execution.
- **risk-train.csv**: Dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Libraries**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
